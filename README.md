# discordhistorytracker-urls-extractor
Created for injesting URLs from DHT scrapes into the Archiveteam URLs project.

SQLITE3 Rust program for extracting most URLs from a Discord History Tracker desktop app database (.dht).

Might not extract all URLs correctly. [#8](https://github.com/TheTechRobo/discordhistorytracker-urls-extractor/pull/8) improved on this, though.
