# discordhistorytracker-urls-extractor
Created for injesting URLs from DHT scrapes into the Archiveteam URLs project.

SQLITE3 Python program for extracting most URLs from a Discord History Tracker desktop app database (.dht).

Probably wont work if the url in question is padded by anything other than spaces, newlines, parentheses (`(` and `)`), and angle brackets (`<` and `>`).
